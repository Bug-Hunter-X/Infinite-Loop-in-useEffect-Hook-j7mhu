This repository demonstrates a common error in React's useEffect hook that results in an infinite loop. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from updating the component's state within the useEffect hook's callback function without appropriate dependency management, leading to a continuous re-rendering and state update cycle.
